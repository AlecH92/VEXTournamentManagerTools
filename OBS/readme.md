## OBS Setup
### OBS Scenes
* Combined View
  * All camera/streams are accessible in case they need to be reset (usually double clicking and hitting "OK" is enough to get them going again)
  * A separate group toggles the Field 3 view. Toggle on for three cameras, toggle off to show an Audience Display in its place
  * Pit Display 1 can be hidden and Pit Display 2 unhidden to show another Pit window. Our usual setup is to have Pit 2 default to Skills Rankings
* Audience Display No Overlay
  * We also use this for TM's "Slides" view during awards, and have a separate Audio/mic to enable for these occasions
* Field # In-Match View
  * These combine the "Field # Camera Only" Scene with an Audience Display with Overlay, along with Audio/mic source from the camera
* The "VEX Scenes.json" can be imported to OBS and already has a two or three camera field setup configured for use with the DisplayControl scripts
* "Field # Camera Only"
  * Scenes can be configued for any supported camera type. We currently use NDI (Logitech Mevo) but have used USB and MJPG-stream based cameras previously.
* Front of Fields View
  * Can be used with a camera source for an "Audience eyes view"

* The "Technical Difficulties" will need to have its image path altered, check out "TECHDIFF" and set it
